# Papers Project
This project contains all of the materials that I've written up that I'm releasing into the world.
## Education
In this folder you'll find course materials for BIO-141/142. Or Anatomy & Physiology 1/2 according to the VCCS course outlines. All practice tests were similar to those that I/other students took as proctored exams. All materials are licensed under CC-BY. Also for BIO-141 there are labeling activities for you to utilize to help you better grasp the anatomy and some of the physiology of the human body.

## Crypto Papers
### RSA Paper.
The paper goes over RSA by hand, how to calculate modular mulitplicative inverses using the Euler method. Attacks are Hastaad Broadcast Attack, Common Modulus, Cubed Root, and Near Prime Factorization. Algorithms are included, and with exception of the proofs portion no prior math experience outside of highschool math is expected.

There is code to carry out all attacks in the appendix so that they can carry them out themselves. Also the last section includes real-world attacks as seen in the wild with the attacks described in the paper. It is shown how to carry out the attacks by-hand so that they can get a feel for it. But the code to do so automatically is included in the appropriate appendix.

###The Hill Paper

The paper goes over how the Hill cipher works. And then takes the reader through the steps of how to encrypt and decrypt by hand. It also goes over how to use a "crib" to calculate the decryption key when only given cipher text. Algorithms are included, along with sample code to carry out the encryption/decryption. Finally a final section shows it being applied to a real world CTF challenge.
